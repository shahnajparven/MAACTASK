## Project setup for `Development`

1. I used `yarn` as my package manager. So, install it by running the `command` bellow.

```bash
npm i -g yarn
# if not work then run
sudo npm i -g yarn
```

2. Clone project on your local machine by running `https://github.com/shahnajparven/technext-test.gitt`

3. Go to the project directory `tech-next` and run `yarn`.

4. Finally run `yarn run dev` to start the dev server.
